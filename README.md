## Introduction

[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) are a platform for continuous integration in GitHub repositories. 
An action encodes a reusable task with configurable parameters.

Xygeni provides a `xygeni-action` for downloading and running the scanner as a step in a GitHub workflow.

## Usage

The `xygeni-action` downloads, configures and executes the Xygeni Scanner on the repository where the action is invoked. 

### Setting API token as encrypted secret in GitHub

The scanner needs an *API token* to communicate with the Xygeni platform. To register in the Xygeni platform, please register in the [xygeni.io](https://xygeni.io/book-a-demo). 

Such API token is a secret that could be registered safely at the appropriate scope (organization, repository or environment) using [GitHub Encrypted Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets).

For example, to register the API token as a secret named `XYGENI_TOKEN`, for the repository in the current working directory, you may use the GitHub `gh` command:

```shell
# The command will prompt you to enter the secret value
gh secret set XYGENI_TOKEN

# Alternatively you may read the value of the API token from a local file
gh secret set XYGENI_TOKEN < /path/to/xygeni_token.txt
```

(You must be the repository owner for creating repository secrets.)

For creating encryption secret at environment scope in a personal account repository (you need to be the repository owner), add `--env ENV_NAME`:

```shell
# Set the secret available to private repositories only
gh secret set --env ENV_NAME XYGENI_TOKEN
```

For creating encryption secret at organization scope (so the secret is available to all or a subset of the organization repositories), add `--org ORG_NAME`:

```shell
# GitHub CLI does not have admin:org permission by default
gh auth login --scopes "admin:org"

# Set the secret available to private repositories only
gh secret set --org ORG_NAME XYGENI_TOKEN

# Or set the secret available to all organization repositories
gh secret set --org ORG_NAME XYGENI_TOKEN --visibility all

# Or limit visibility of the secret to the selected repos
gh secret set --org ORG_NAME XYGENI_TOKEN --visibility all
```

You may use the corresponding GitHub webpages for setting the api token as a secret named `XYGENI_TOKEN` at the appropriate scope.

### Add a step calling the action to a workflow

In a GitHub workflow (`.github/*.yml`) the Xygeni scanner could be run on the repository files, 
typically after `actions/checkout` to retrieve the branch sources. 
The `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` environment variable will contain the default location of the repository when using the checkout action.

You can configure a GitHub action with the form:
```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]

jobs:
  xygeni-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: xygeni-github-action
    steps:
      # Checkout the repository sources (GITHUB_WORKSPACE)
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@vv3.1.0
        
      - name: Xygeni-Scanner
        uses: xygeni/xygeni-action@v1.0.0
        id: Xygeni-Scanner
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.XYGENI_TOKEN }}
```

Where `XYGENI_TOKEN` is the name of the encrypted secret where the API token was saved.


### Parameters

Only the API token (or alternatively the username + password) is required.

The default values for some parameters can be changed. For example, you may specify a specific name for the project instead of the GitNug repository name (GITHUB_REPOSITORY). Also, you may want to scan a particular source subdirectory instead of the default, por example `${{ github.repository }}/src`. 
You can see more information about default GitHub environment variables [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/environment-variables#default-environment-variables).

The available parameters for the action are:

> **Tip:** Use `fail_on = never` to avoid breaking the build if the scan finds issues or fails.
> You may also use `fail_on = severity:critical` to terminate the build only when critical issues are found.

> **Tip:** Use `run = secrets,iac` if you want to scan only for secrets and IaC flaws, for example.
